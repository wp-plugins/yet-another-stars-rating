Yet Another Stars Rating is a simple plugin which allows you and / or your visitor to rate a post or element. Ideal for review's website

== Description ==
Yet Another Stars Rating (YASR) is a new system review based on jquery plugin RateIT. 
With YASR you can make your own review or let your visitors vote, and you can even create multiple sets (a set of stars for each aspect to
rate). Review scores or visitor ratings will be indexed by search engines through snippets .
Most important, if you are a gd star rating user, with YASR you can import all the data from gd star rating (which isn't maintained anymore).

= How To use =

= Reviewer Vote =
Once YASR is installed, when you create or update a page or a post, a box (metabox) will be available in the upper right corner where you'll
be able to insert the overall rating. You can either place the overall rating automatically at the beginning or the end of a post (look in "Settings"
-> "Yet Another Stars Rating: Settings"), or wherever you want in the page using the shortcode [yasr_overall_rating] (easily added through the visual editor).

= Visitor Votes = 
You can give your users the ability to vote, pasting the shortcode [yasr_visitor_votes] where you want the stars to appear.
Again, this can be placed automatically at the beginning or the end of each post; the option is in "Settings" -> "Yet Another Stars Rating: Settings".
This may not works if you use a caching plugin.

= Multi Set =
Multisets give the opportunity to score different aspects for each review: for example, if you're reviewing a videogame, you can create the aspects "Graphics",
"Gameplay", "Story", etc.

= Importing data from gd star rating =
If you're using gd-star-rating, YASR is the plugin for you! You can import from gd-star-rating "Overall Rating", "Visitor Votes" and all the multisets with
their respective score. Once YASR is installed you just have to go to "Settings" -> "Yet Another Stars Rating: Settings" and start the import (last box at the bottom).
This operation can take some time, don't stop it! Once it's done you just need to replace the gd-star-rating's shortcode with the YASR tags.
If with gd-star-rating you're using a different number of stars from the default of 5, YASR will automatically convert all the scores in a range from 1 to 5.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is "Overall Rating"? =
It is the vote given by who writes the review: readers are able to see this vote in read-only mode. Reviewer can vote using the box on the top rigth when writing a new article or post (he or she must have at least the "Author" role). Remember to insert this shortcode **[yasr_overall_rating]** to make it appear where you like. You can choose to make it appear just in a single post/page or in archive pages too (e.g. default Index, category pages, etc).

= What is "Visitor Rating"? =
It is the vote that allows your visitors to vote: just paste this shortcode **[yasr_visitor_votes]** where you want the stars to appear. This may not works if you use a caching plugin.

= What is "Multi Set"? =
It is the feature that makes YASR awesome. Multisets give the opportunity to score different aspects for each review: for example, if you're reviewing a videogame, you can create the aspects "Graphics", "Gameplay", "Story", etc. and give a vote for each one. To create a set, just go in "Settings" -> "Yet Another Stars Rating: Settings" and click on the "Multi Sets" tab. To insert it into a post, just paste the shortcode that YASR will create for you. 

= What is "Ranking reviews" ? =
It is the 10 highest rated item chart by reviewer. In order to insert it into a post or page, just paste this shortcode **[yasr_top_ten_highest_rated]**

= What is "Users' ranking" ? =
This is 2 charts in 1. Infact, this chart shows both the most rated posts/pages or the highest rated posts/pages. 
For an item to appear in this chart, it has to be rated twice at least.
Paste this shortcode to make it appear where you want **[yasr_most_or_highest_rated_posts]**

= What is "Most active reviewers" ? =
If in your site there are more than 1 person writing reviews, this chart will show the 5 most active reviewers. Shortcode is **[yasr_top_5_reviewers]**

= What is "Most active users" ? =
When a visitor (logged in or not) rates a post/page, his rating is stored in the database. This chart will show the 10 most active users, displaying the login name if logged in or "Anonymous" otherwise. The shortcode : **[yasr_top_ten_active_users]**

= Wait, wait! Do I need to keep in mind all this shortcode? =
Of course not: you can easily add it on the visual editor just by clicking on the yellow star and then choose what to insert.
